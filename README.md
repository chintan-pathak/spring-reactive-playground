# Spring Boot Reactive Playground

A simple Spring Boot application to demonstrate and explore **Reactive Programming** concepts with **Spring WebFlux**. This project serves as a **Proof of Concept (POC)** to understand how reactive systems can be built using Spring Boot.

## Features

- **Reactive REST APIs** using `Mono` and `Flux`
- **Non-blocking I/O** with Spring WebFlux
- **Reactive Database** support (e.g., MongoDB)
- **WebClient** for asynchronous HTTP calls

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot** (WebFlux)
- **Project Reactor** (Mono, Flux)
- **MongoDB** (optional for reactive DB support)
- **WebClient** (for reactive HTTP calls)
